Design a stack which, in addition to `push` and `pop`, has a function which returns the minimum element? `Push`, `pop` and `min` should all operate in $$ O(1) $$ time.

#### Solutions
At first glance, a simple solution appears to be adding an intribute attribute to the `Stack` class which keeps track of the minimum value in the stack. However, this solution will not operate in $$ O(1) $$ time. When the minimum element is removed from the stack, the class will need to perform a search to find the new minimum element, and the search will take $$ O(n) $$ time.

A different solution involves adding an attribute to the `Node` class, which keeps track of the minimum element below that node in the stack. When a new node is added to the stack, this attribute can be calculated by comparing the `min` of the previous top of the stack against the value of the added element.

```python
class StackNode:
  def __init__(self, value):
    self.value = value
    self.min = None
    self.next = None

class Stack:
  def __init__(self):
    self.top = None

  def push(self, value):
    if(self.top == None):
      node = StackNode(value)
      node.min = value
      self.top = node

    else:
      node = StackNode(value)
      node.min = min(value, self.top.min)
      node.next = self.top
      self.top = node

  def pop(self):
    value = self.top.value
    self.top = self.top.next
    return value

  def min(self):
    return self.top.min
```

One disadvantage to this approach is the extra space required to store the minimum at each node. A solution which requires less space involves creating two stacks, one to keep track of the values, and another to keep track of the minima. When a value is removed from the stack, if the value is the same as the top of the minima stack, we can pop off the top element of both stacks to reveal the new minimum.

```python
class Node:
  def __init__(self, value):
    self.value = value
    self.next = None

class StackWithMin:
  def __init__(self):
    self.minimum = None
    self.top = None

  def push(self, value):
    if(self.minimum):
      if(value < self.minimum.value):
        node = Node(value)
        node.next = self.minimum
        self.minimum = node

      n = Node(value)
      n.next = self.top
      self.top = n
    else:
      node = Node(value)
      self.minimum = node

      n = Node(value)
      self.top = n

  def pop(self):
    value = self.top
    self.top = self.top.next

    if(value == self.minimum.value):
      self.minimum = self.minimum.next

    return value

  def min(self):
    return self.minimum.value
```

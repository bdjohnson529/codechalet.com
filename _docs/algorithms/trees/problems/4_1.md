Given a directed graph and two nodes (A and E), design an algorithm to find out whether there is a route from A to E.

#### Solution
This problem can be solved using a graph search, starting at node S. If node E is found during the graph search, we can return `True`. Otherwise, we will return `False`.

Let's implement a breadth-first search, since it will be more efficient than a depth-first search. A DFS might be simpler to implement, but it will be less efficient. If the nodes are neighboring nodes, we might not know until the search algorithm has explored several branches.

```python
def route_exists(graph, node_1, node_2):
  visited = set()
  queue = []

  if(node_1 == node_2):
    return True

  queue.append(node_1)

  while(queue):
    node = queue.pop(0)
    visited.add(node)

    if(node == node_2):
      return True

    for neighbor in graph[node]:
      queue.append(neighbor)

  return False
```

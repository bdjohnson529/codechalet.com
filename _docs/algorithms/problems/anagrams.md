Write a function that will find all the anagrams of a word from a list. You will be given two inputs: a word and an array of words. You should return an array of all the anagrams, or an empty array if there are none. For example:
```ruby
anagrams('racer', ['crazer', 'carer', 'racar', 'caers', 'racer']) => ['carer', 'racer']
```

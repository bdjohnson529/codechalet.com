Given two singly linked lists, determine if the two lists intersect. Return the intersecting node. Note that the intersection is defined based on reference, not value. That is, if the kth node of the first linked list is the exact same node (by reference) as the jth node of the second linked list, then they are intersection.

#### Solution
If two linked lists intersect, the last element of both lists will be the same. Observe the diagram below for proof. To identify if two linked lists intersect, we can compare their tails.

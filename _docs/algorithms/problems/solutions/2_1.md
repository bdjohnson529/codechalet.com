When evaluating time complexity, keep in mind the time complexity of the following operations:

* sorting an array - $$ O(n \ log \ n) $$
* iterating through an array -  $$ O(n) $$

## 2.1 Remove Duplicates
Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.

#### Solution
The solution is fairly straight forward. We will iterate through the linked list, and keep track of unique values in a separate data structure. When we encounter a duplicate element, we will delete it from the list.

```python
def remove_duplicates(linked_list):
  node = linked_list.head
  unique_values = []

  while node:
    if node.value in unique_values:
      linked_list.delete(node)
    else:
      unique_values.append(node.value)

    node = node.next
```

The solution will iterate through the linked list once, so the time complexity is $$ O(n) $$.

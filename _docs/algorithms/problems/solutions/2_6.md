Implement a function to check if a linked list is a palindrome.

#### Solution
To solve this problem, we can reverse the linked list and compare the result against the original linked list. Let's write a function to reverse a linked list. The function will accept the head of the linked list, and return the head of the reversed linked list.

```python
def reverse_list(node):
  head = None

  while(node != None):
    new = Node(node.value)
    new.next = head
    head = new
    node = node.next

  return head
```

Now, we need a function to compare two linked lists and validate that they are equal. This function will iterate through the lists simultaneously and return `False` if the values are ever different.

```python
def is_equal(one, two):
  while(one != None and two != None):
    if(one.value != two.value):
      return False

    one = one.next
    two = two.next

  return True
```

Notice that the function above will not work if the lists are of different size. The `while` loop will terminate prematurely, and the function will return `True` if all of the values in the shorter list are equal to the values in the larger list. This is incorrect - lists of different sizes are not equal and the function should return `False`. However, since we are generating the second linked list, we can ensure that it is the same size as the parent.

The `reverse_list` function takes time $$ O(n) $$, and the `is_equal` function also takes time $$ O(n) $$. The total time of this algorithm is $$ O(2n) $$.

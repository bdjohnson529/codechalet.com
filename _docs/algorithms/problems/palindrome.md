Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearanngement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words. You can ignore casing and non-letter characters.

Write a recursive function to multiply two positive integers without using the `*` operator. You can use addition, subtraction, and bit shifting, but you should minimize the number of those operations.

#### Solution
This problem is a great introductory problem for recursion. Let's say we are multiplying two numbers, `a * b`. The base case is simple - when `a = 1`, we will return `b`. When `a > 0`, we will recurse, adding `b` all the way up the recursion tree. The depth of the recursion tree is `a`.

```python
def recursive_multiply(a, b):
  if(a == 1):
    return b

  return b + recursive_multiply(a-1, b)
```

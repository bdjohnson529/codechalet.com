In the classic problem of the Towers of Hanoi, you have 3 towers and `n` disks of different sizes which can slide onto any tower. The puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending order of size from top to bottom. You have the following constraints:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. A disk is slid off the top of one tower onto another tower.
3. A disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.

Write a program to move the disks from the first tower to the last using stacks.

#### Solution
Let's first discuss the base case. It is trivial to move one disk from the origin to the destination. For two disks, the procedure looks like so :

```python
[1,2], [],    []
[2],   [],    [1]
[],    [2],   [1]
[],    [1,2], []
```

In order to move `n` disks from the origin to the destination, we need to move `n-1` disks from the origin to the buffer, move disk `n` to the destination, and move disks `{1 ... n-1}` from the buffer to the destination.

The base case of our recursion is when `n <= 0`, in which case we terminate the recursion.

```python
def move_disks(n, origin, destination, buffer):
  if(n <= 0):
    return

  move_disks(n-1, origin, buffer, destination)

  disk = origin.pop()
  destination.push(disk)

  move_disks(n-1, buffer, destination, origin)
```

This is the fourth chapter of the guide explaining how to build a serverless notification system using AWS. Here is a review of the first three chapters.
1. We built a Lambda function which is capable of sending an email via SES.
2. We created an API Gateway to invoke the Lambda function.
3. We created an authorization function for API Gateway.

In this chapter we will learn how to transmit data in AJAX requests from the client to API Gateway.

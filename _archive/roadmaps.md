SMALL ENGINEERING TEAMS usually have an enormous backlog of new products and features, especially when they are experiencing rapid growth. The natural response to this pressure is to quickly build a minimum viable solution for each product or feature, and then move on to the next solution. However, I think there are advantages to be had by taking the time to formalize a technical plan for the product.

When I was working as a software engineer for a small R&D company, we were handed numerous projects with tight deadlines. We would build an MVP as quickly as possible, deliver the prototype, and then move onto the next project. The next time we wanted to unshelve one of these solutions, we always had to spend a few hours digging into the code to become reacquainted with the solution architecture.

I believe that technical teams of any sort can reap tremendous benefits by simply mapping out their processes. I like to call these maps **technical product roadmaps**. That is really just a fancy way to say formalized plan. The map should explain step-by-step, how a program or analysis works. The roadmap should explain your engineering process in plain English to a five year old.

Creating the technical roadmap does demand an investment of valuable engineering time, but I think that all engineering teams will find the benefits to pay back this investment many times over. That's a bold generalization, so let's dive into the benefits.

1. **Roadmaps empower communication.**
<br><br>You can show the roadmap to anyone, regardless of their technical background. You can show the roadmap to your manager, the product team, or a new hire and easily explain your solution architecture.

2. **Roadmaps remove dependencies.**
<br><br>Many technical products are complex. If this process is only known to one person, there will always be a dependency on that person. By mapping out the entire process, you remove dependencies and empower anyone on the engineering team to contribute.

3. **Roadmaps facilitate benchmarking.**
<br><br>A roadmap breaks a continuous process down into a series of discrete steps. The engineering team can measure each of these steps and identify which steps merit the most attention.

4. **Roadmaps demand understanding.**
<br><br>To write a roadmap, you need to understand each step of your process, and how they relate to each other. More than a few times, I have discovered a gap in my knowledge while building a technical roadmap.

The solutions built by R&D teams, and data science teams, are often technically complex. I think all team members will benefit from technical roadmaps which describe and document solution architecture.

We live in an age of possibility. Engineering and data science teams are capable of building immensely powerful products. The question for any company with skilled programmers has evolved from *"Can we build that?"* to *"Should we build that?".*

Product companies revolve around this question. Within the amorphous discipline of data science, however, the distinction between products can be vague. Data is usually transferred from a customer to the data science team, some analysis is performed, and the analysis is delivered to the customer. **The customer is usually both the source of the data and the consumer of the data analysis.**

The journey of data from inception to consumption is long. Sensor data is usually not clean or structured. Software is needed to clean the sensor data and impose some sort of organization. After the data has been cleaned, it may need to be aggregated. Finally, the data can be analyzed. Each step of the data supply chain is only as accurate as the previous steps. If the data is not cleaned well, your analyses will not produce valuable results.

There is plenty of room within the data supply chain. The problems to be solved are challenging enough to merit collaboration from a number of teams. And there are enough customers to support competition. If your company delivers a mediocre product, you can probably still find customers.

But for a moment, consider this hypothetical. **What if your company made itself indisposable in your customer's data supply chain?** What if your company became the best in the world at some specific function in the data engineering or data science domain?

This is where engineering and data science teams deliver real value. The analogy between data science and consumable goods is useful, especially to put your product into context. For every manufacturer of cotton textiles, there are thousands of competitors. No matter the product, you will experience competition. **The real question is, what is your organization better at than anyone else?**

With that long-winded preface, I will now present a framework for valuing technical products, on data science and data engineering teams.

### 1. The end-user is ALWAYS the customer.

Data science is a multi-step process. Often there is an ETL process performed before data can be analyzed. ETL products can be valuable, but **only if they hold value to the customer.** If the ETL process benefits only your interal team, that process holds no value to the customer who is writing your checks.

### 2. Consider the skillset of your team.

In the new world of ubiquitous tech, it is possible to learn and build almost any tool, given enough time. You may have one or two programmers who are capable of pushing the envelope. I urge any company to consider the technical skillset they are investing in. Products require support - I have not heard of a product which runs perfectly and requires no maintenance.

Your investments in technical products should reflect your investments in technical education. It is not enough to have one person maintain a product which no one else is capable of contributing to. Software is more effective when built by teams.

### 3. Leverage the data supply chain.

The reality is you are part of a data supply chain which is larger than your company. To the customer, you are simply one of many data vendors. To increase the value of your technical product, reduce its scope to the value which is perceived by the customer. If your customer is asking for a data analysis, **chances are there is a data vendor upstream which is cleaning the input dataset.** The customer's overarching goal is to optimize the data supply chain, which means connecting data vendors with each other.

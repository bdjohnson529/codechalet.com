It can be difficult to evoke change in a large organization. Large companies have a lot of intertia and momentum which makes it difficult to change course. Investment in large organizations is often regulated, especially during periods of financial difficulty.

Ironically, during periods of financial stress, investment is the most critical. As the market shrinks, so do the fish swimming in the market. Investors throughout the value chain need to maximize the value of their investments. With less money to go around, we need to make sure it adds value when we spend it.

How do you quantify value? One way is to estimate the number of dollars an investment will earn. If the investment is successful, it will earn more dollars than it cost. New products which bring in new dollars offer an especially attractive ROI. There is an associated risk, however, that the new product is not successful and does not earn any dollars.

What is the investment with the least risk? Investment in education. I think there is tremendous value for organizations to invest in internal education, especially during times of financial stress.
